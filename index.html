                    In Mail Art and the Big Monster, Ulises Carrión explores the meaning behind creating 
"mail art" and the impact that creating such art has on society. As Carrión states, "Mail 
Art uses the mail as support in the sense that non­ mail arts use canvas, paper. iron, and 
wood as support". Carrión continues to reaffirm and expound upon this statement, 
reaffirming the idea that artists must not use the mail system as a medium for art, but 
rather as a support they can build upon to create art using a multitude of media. While 
doing so, Carrión seems to believe that artists who limit themselves to creating 
postcards are not truly "Mail artists". I'm unsure if I agree with this idea, since art itself is 
often subjective and up to the audience/artist's interpretation.<br><br>

 
Carrión describes the "Big Monster" as "the owner of the Castle, who separates us one 
from the others, all of us". Although Carrión does not give a clear definition as to what 
the "Big Monster" represents in this passage, Carrión's writing allows us to infer that the 
"Big Monster" may be the "system" that artists and non-artists alike struggle to combat. 
In the case of Mail Art, this may relate more to the government and the policies it enacts 
that may not benefit citizens as a whole. However, I think Mail Art may also feed the 
system it fights against, as artists must abide by the rules and regulations the "Big 
Monster" creates when creating "mail art".<br><br>

 
Discussion Questions: <br><br>
How does an artist's interpretation of "Mail Art" affect the quality of the art they produce?<br><br>
While Carrión writes that through Mail Art artists are part of the "guerrilla war against the 
Big Monster", does Mail Art also feed and support the Big Monster along the way by 
abiding by the system it creates?

                    In How Do You Use the Internet Mindfully, Laurel Schwulst explores the definition of a website. 
                    Throughout the essay, Schwulst progressively gives more abstract examples of websites, 
                    culminating in "Website as thrown rock that’s now falling deep into the ocean", a metaphor 
                    which demonstrates the extent of the many different processes one can follow when creating a 
                    website. I think this approach to creating websites is quite similar to the many different mediums 
                    and workflows artists utilize when creating art. In addition, as artists can both express 
                    themselves through their art and express a collective ambition, Schwulst stresses that artists in 
                    particular are able to understand that expressing yourself through creating one website out of 
                    the many more that exist is, "an individual act of collective ambition". <br><br>

                    In On Building Knowledge Networks, Édouard U warns about the danger of "conceptual 
                    isolation", which creates echo chambers that prevent individuals from exploring different modes 
                    of thinking. In order to combat this, Édouard U recommends departing "from the linear 
                    narrative", or consuming all that the web has to offer. I think this line of thinking is especially 
                    relevant to the internet nowadays, which can become extremely targeted towards individuals to 
                    the point where everything they consume online is catered towards their interests and beliefs. <br><br>

                    How do you successfully convey the purpose of your website?<br><br>

                    In this excerpt, Olia Lialina details the history of the web hosting service Geocities, which shut 
                    down in 2009 after the "home pages" that it hosted became obsolete in favor of social media 
                    platforms. For many amateur users of the web, Geocities was a form of self-expression and 
                    contained many sub-communities that users could join. It's interesting how even in the early 
                    state of the web that Geocities existed in, there still existed a form of order within the space and 
                    specific sets of rules for users to follow.  The images provided in the passage also provide 
                    examples of what Geocities "home pages" looked like in the browser, which highlights the 
                    contrast between the websites of the late 1990's and early 2000's and the websites of today. 
                    The usage of "clear.gif" or "0.gif" as a spacer between website elements that might have serious 
                    repercussions if deleted is also interesting to consider as a remnant of Geocities in today's 
                    internet. <br><br>

                    

                    Questions:<br><br>

                    Geocities's aesthetic is nostalgically memorable as that of the early internet. As web design 
                    continues to evolve and change, do you see a possible resurgence in "revamping" the early 
                    internet aesthetic using tools available to web designers today?<br><br>


                    What other platforms similar to Geocities did users populate at the time? What made Geocities 
                    stand out among them, or was there a different platform that dominated among web hosting 
                    services in the late 1990's and early 2000's?<br><br>

                    In A *New* Program for Graphic Design, Reinfurt explores the intricacies to graphic design and 
                    the history of several concepts in design that many may not be aware of. In particular, I found 
                    the section where he explored optical illusions such as the "waterfall effect" to be interesting in 
                    relation to its applications in graphic design. The principle behind this phenomenon was also 
                    much more scientific-based than I expected. In addition, Reinfurt explored the idea of a visual 
                    syntax later in the passage, including examples of several different kinds of loading cursors and 
                    designs. The emotions that different shapes and designs evoke can, in a way, communicate 
                    with the viewer using their own language. In my opinion, making a design effectively 
                    communicate the creator's intentions to the viewer is one of the most important aspects of 
                    graphic design, so I enjoyed reading about Reinfurt's analysis on the topic.<br><br>

                    

                    Questions:<br><br>

                    Is there a way to effectively incorporate Gestalt principles into design in an obvious manner 
                    without losing the original intention of a design?<br><br>

                    Not only do the ideas Reinfurt analyzes in the passage relate to design, but they also have 
                    strong connections to other art forms such as animation. How do these design concepts change 
                    when applied to animation and video?<br><br>

                    In Post-Digital-Print, Alessandro Ludovico explores print as a medium and the transition between print 
                    publications to digital publishing. As digital publishing slowly became more and more popular, 
                    traditional print publishing faces an ever-shrinking customer base. I related to the paragraph 
                    where Ludovico mentioned this pipeline, as many newspapers today have switched to an online 
                    format easily accessible from a phone or computer rather than physical paper. In addition, 
                    Ludovico went on to describe "DIY print publishing" in the form of zines. I'm unsure whether I 
                    agree with Ludovico's comment that DIY print publishing is not able to "initiate social or media 
                    processes", as I think DIY print publishing definitely has the potential to be used for activism 
                    purposes. However, when taking into consideration how DIY print publishing is now being used 
                    to promote fanart and appeal to fan consumption of media rather than for activism, I don't see a 
                    resurgence in "print activism" in the future.<br><br>

                    Florian Cramer's afterword explores what form of media post-digital printmaking may take. In 
                    particular, the passage states that "post-digital print would need to include networked 
                    community sharing which is both local/tangible and global/digital". I think this is one of the most 
                    important differences between print publishing for books compared to print publishing that 
                    engages with a community.<br><br>


                    

                    Questions:<br><br>

                    While print publications have become more and more rare, art prints have remained quite 
                    popular within fandom culture due to the ties they have to fan media in general. How do the 
                    pipelines for print publications and art prints differ?<br><br>


                    The passage emphasizes "community" and social networks as an integral part of print 
                    publishing and publishing in general. Would online newsletters be a successful example of 
                    digital publishing?<br><br>

                    In Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook, Coklyat and Finnegan describe the many usages alt-text can 
                    serve and the many different approaches one can take to writing alt-text. In particular, the 
                    passage discusses the purpose of alt-text in regards to the needs of the intended audience. 
                    This is in contrast to the "alt-text as poetry" mindset that the passage also covers and 
                    encourages the reader to consider. I agree with the authors that thinking of alt-text as merely an 
                    alternative description of an image severely limits the creative decisions one can take with 
                    writing alt-text, especially because an image may not only be made up of purely visual 
                    descriptions, but may also evoke specific emotions within the audience. By limiting the alt-text to 
                    only describing the visual elements of an image, the writer loses the context of the image within 
                    the source and prevents the alt-text readers from engaging in the entire experience. While 
                    images are made up of colors and linework that present an idea to the audience, poetry is made 
                    up of words and phrases that are meant to similarly portray an idea or evoke a specific medium. 
                    Targeting each artistic medium to a specific environment enables the creator better express 
                    their thoughts to a wider audience in general.<br><br>

                    

                    Questions:<br><br>

                    How do you balance writing good alt-text with maintaining the original intent of an image?<br><br>

                    While images are often more of the focus rather than the alt-text of an image, are there 
                    scenarios where the reverse might occur? And how would those scenarios differ artistically from 
                    those that have images/visual mediums as the focus?<br><br>

                    In Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook, Coklyat and Finnegan describe the many usages alt-text can 
                    serve and the many different approaches one can take to writing alt-text. In particular, the 
                    passage discusses the purpose of alt-text in regards to the needs of the intended audience. 
                    This is in contrast to the "alt-text as poetry" mindset that the passage also covers and 
                    encourages the reader to consider. I agree with the authors that thinking of alt-text as merely an 
                    alternative description of an image severely limits the creative decisions one can take with 
                    writing alt-text, especially because an image may not only be made up of purely visual 
                    descriptions, but may also evoke specific emotions within the audience. By limiting the alt-text to 
                    only describing the visual elements of an image, the writer loses the context of the image within 
                    the source and prevents the alt-text readers from engaging in the entire experience. While 
                    images are made up of colors and linework that present an idea to the audience, poetry is made 
                    up of words and phrases that are meant to similarly portray an idea or evoke a specific medium. 
                    Targeting each artistic medium to a specific environment enables the creator better express

                    In Beyond the New Media Frame: The Poetics of Absence in Vera Frenkel's String Games, Dot 
                    Tuer explores String Games as an example of "new media art". "String Games" is a series of 
                    performances serving as artistic representations of interpersonal relationships in the age of 
                    technology. I think the "Poetics of Absence" that Tuer describes may refer to the lack of 
                    understanding one may have of others when only viewing them through a screen. I found it 
                    surprising that "String Games" was not mentioned or included in exhibitions or major 
                    publications. However, Frenkel being a woman artist experimenting with new technology does 
                    explain this unfortunate fact.<br><br>

                    

                    Questions:<br><br>

                    How does the increasing rate of technological advancement further influence what
                    performances such as String Games can be performed?<br><br>

                    Are there any other projects similar to String Games that involve creative usage of video in the
                    performance?<br><br>

                    In Performing the Feed, Paul Soulellis explores the limitless possibilities of internet "feeds". 
                    Compared to before the internet, where messages had to have a defined beginning and end, it's 
                    possible to scroll for what feels like forever on social media networks today. I agree with 
                    Soulellis that this new development is a major cause of internet addiction, the idea of seeing 
                    something that triggers our interest to enough to keep us locked onto our screens. Additionally, 
                    the presence of social media algorithms further strengthens the performance aspect of the 
                    internet. Since the algorithm may behave differently for every social media user, every user is 
                    part of a different "performance", an echo chamber tailored specifically to their interests. 
                    Soulellis also mentions that media bots and advertisements cause trust issues for users who 
                    question whether the content they see is genuine. I think that the section about "The Listeners" 
                    to be an interesting mode of performance and a compelling experiment that questions the way 
                    we treat virtual assistants and bots.<br><br>

                    

                    Questions:<br><br>

                    How have the "trust issues" many have with media on the internet been further exacerbated by 
                    the usage of generative AI?<br><br>

                    Many treat Youtube advertisements as annoying interruptions to otherwise enjoyable content. 
                    Are advertisements such as these also part of a larger "performance" created by the algorithm?<br><br>

                    This week's reading, Beyond Dark Matter, reads like a children's story, unlike many of the 
                    previous reading assignments for this class. I greatly enjoyed the graphic novel format of this 
                    reading and I thought the language the authors used in the story made many of the complicated 
                    topics they discussed more approachable to a younger audience. Additionally, I didn't expect for 
                    the story to include a historical timeline of the origins of computer technology and the racial 
                    implications behind such history, which I was also not aware of before this reading. Ultimately, 
                    this story encourages us to keep in mind the broader picture when working with computers, 
                    ending with the main character, Gem, giving back to her community by helping other people fix 
                    their computer.<br><br>

                    

                    Questions:<br><br>

                    1. "Another way is always possible" is a main theme of the story. Does this phrase also apply to 
                    our relationship with other forms of modern technology as well as computers?<br><br>

                    2. How can the knowledge of the racial implications behind the history of computers be made 
                    more available to the general public?<br><br>

                    In Art on the Internet, Boris Groys raises the question of whether too much context, in regards to 
                    knowledge about an art piece or artist, obstructs the traditional critique and appreciation of art. 
                    Groys describes this process as "defictionalization", where the frames that devices such as 
                    phones and computers create are inescapable and thus prevent users from fully experiencing 
                    art on the internet. I thought that the "globalization of the author", as Groys describes, is an 
                    interesting point of view on how art is treated much like a business nowadays rather than a 
                    process of creation. Since your audience can be anyone and everyone, many artists focus on 
                    "putting themselves out there" to better share their content with others. However, Groys argues 
                    that in order to survive in this culture nowadays, an artist must not only be globally present but 
                    also locally familiar. I also thought the section about "surveillance" to be particularly relatable. 
                    Many artists that I follow online have posted work-in-progress drawings, speedpaints, and 
                    timelapses that illuminate their creative process. While I have always seen this as a positive 
                    aspect of the internet, as I often draw inspiration from their creative processes and am 
                    interested in applying their methods to creating my own art, the passage points towards the 
                    "objectification" of artists on the internet. As Groys states, "creative work is creative because it 
                    takes place beyond public control - and even beyond the conscious control of the author". The 
                    creative process is an integral part of an artist's identity, and the internet, in making it public, 
                    takes away that part of the identity.<br><br>

                    

                    Questions:<br><br>

                    In the world of today, commodification of art and the artistic process is unavoidable. What steps 
                    can be taken or have already been taken to try and hinder this process?<br><br>

                    Groys views the power of the Internet in decontexualizing and recontexualizing historical art via 
                    "cut-and-paste" operations in a positive light. Do you agree? <br><br>
